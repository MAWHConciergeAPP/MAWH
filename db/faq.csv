2,Are Beach Wheelchairs available?,Yes.  It is best to reserve these through your chapter prior to arrival due to limited availability.  If you need one on island please contact MAWH directly to make arrangements.
3,Can I drive or take a ferry to another island?,No.  All islands are seperated by water and plane is the recommended transportation between islands.
4,Can I visit another island on a free day?,Yes this is possible but it is expensive and you will spend the majority of your time in airports and rental vehicles which can be very tiresome for medically fragile wish kids and young children.
5,Is there public transportation available if I don't drive?,Yes there is a bus system and taxi. Uber and Lyft are also available.
6,What is the best beach?,This will depend on your family.  The ocean is very unpredictable and can be very dangerous especially during winter months.  We recommend the lagoons on the West side and Waikiki for young children.  If it is summer time the North Shore is beautiful.  Check out Sunset beach or Three Tables beach.  
7,Where should we eat?,There are some great restaurants on island and all different types of food.  Check out the Grindz page for staff recommendations.

9,What should we do on our free days?,Check out the activities page for specific activities and recommended vendors.  Hawaii is a great place to spend the day at the beach. Go to the North Shore or venture down to Waikiki or the mall for some shopping.
10,What should we do if it rains?,There are lots of fun indoor activities on island but don't worry it rartely rains and usually only for short periods of time.  Check out Dave and Buster's; iTrampoline; Iolani Palace; the Aquarium; the Bishop Museum for some indoor fun.  Also click over to the activities page for other suggestions. 
11,What do we do if we need medical attention?,Please contact Make-A-Wish Hawaii as soon as you can as they can assist you.  In addition check out the Medical page here for emergency information and urgent care locations.
12,What if there is a severe weather warning?,Your hotel is the safest place for you and your family to be during storms. These are rare in Hawaii but possible since we are in the Pacific.  The hotel's have an emergency plan in place and are constructed specifically to withstand storms and high winds.
