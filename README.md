# Make-A-Wish Hawaii Concierge App

## Concept
This website and app are designed to serve the Wish children and their families traveling to Hawaii on their Wish trips to assist with logistical questions and provide more information to make their travel experience less stressful and time in Hawaii more enjoyable.  Make-A-Wish is a non-profit organization that grants the wishes of children with a life threatening medical condition to enrich their lives with hope, strength, and joy.

## Phase I
It is intended to provide a quick one stop app for families that gives them additional information on their itinerary, medical facilities, food and activity options.  We have build in login in authentication for privacy and security, added chapter contact information in case of emergency all with the ease of a single sign on feature.

## Phase II
Additional elements to be added are a text feature that reminds families of their daily schedule as well as emergency weather advisories.

Currently, this app only features one island, but we would like to build it out to encompass all islands and eventually other locations.

We would also like to build in a contact page to contact the chapter staff and an administrator page in which a chapter staff member can import itineraries and update tables easily.

## Design Process Planning
Prior to building, the team determined our concept by brainstorming ideas. We then hashed out the concept further by asking if it has real world relevance, what makes it different from other websites and apps and determined the different team interests and skill sets to ensure project success. 

We created a mock up of the design and discussed the requirements for the users and deisred functionality of the app.  The UI/UX design that was built pretty closely replicated the initial design mock up.  The backend database, api and html routes as well as the coding for authentication was designed and built out concurrently.

Upon initial completion of different features testing and Q/A was done by each developer and then as the site came together, whole units were tested and reviewed for functionality as well as consistant design elements.
Upon completeion of testing, the site was implemented via GitHub Pages: https://mawhconciergeapp.github.io/MAWH/ as well as to heroku:
